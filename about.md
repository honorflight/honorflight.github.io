## Greater St. Louis Honor Flight
Our mission is simple.  Safely transport World War II veterans to see their National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. As quickly as possible. Because we are losing 900+ WWII veterans a day, we would like to locate and fly as many of these vets as possible.

### The Initiative
[Company] and [Universities/Communities], in a partner effort, are going to start a system that hels Honor Flight's business move forward.
